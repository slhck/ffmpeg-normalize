A utility for batch-normalizing audio using ffmpeg.

This program normalizes media files to a certain loudness level using the EBU R128 loudness normalization procedure. It can also perform RMS-based normalization (where the mean is lifted or attenuated), or peak normalization to a certain target level.

Batch processing of several input files is possible, including video files.

## Quick Start


1. Install a recent version of [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
2. Run `pip3 install ffmpeg-normalize` and `ffmpeg-normalize /path/to/your/file.mp4`, alternatively install [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) and run `uvx ffmpeg-normalize /path/to/your/file.mp4`
3. Done! ðŸŽ§ (the normalized file will be called `normalized/file.mkv`)
